AB  - Computational thinking refers to thinking and solving issues in the same way as computer scientists do. This study aims to evaluate the computational thinking skills of prospective elementary teachers. This study uses a quantitative descriptive research method. The research instrument uses a computational thinking skills test containing four indicators, namely decomposition, algorithm, pattern recognition, abstraction/generalization. The subjects of this study were 244 prospective elementary teachers from a Study Program of Elementary School Teacher Education at a public university in Pekanbaru, Riau, Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the computational thinking skills of prospective elementary teachers are in the moderate category. Among the four indicators, prospective elementary teachers' skills of decomposition and pattern recognition are higher than algorithm and abstraction/generalization.

AB  - Teaching with educational robots is increasingly being integrated into the curriculum. However, many teachers, and especially those who have been in practice for a long time have not been trained in this area. Therefore, in-service teacher training in educational robotics is now an important area. In the framework of the Erasmus FERTILE project, materials on this topic have been developed. Based on these, teacher training is being implemented in several European countries in 2024. Participants are introduced to educational robotics in combination with arts, with a particular focus on the development of computational thinking skills. In this paper, we focus on the final part of the training, in which a peer assessment using a rubric was used to evaluate the projects created. We demonstrate the inter-rater reliability of the rubric applied and use the results of the peer assessment to verify the participants' level of understanding of computational thinking.

AB  - This feasibility study investigates the practicality of incorporating Computational Thinking (CT) education into secondary school curricula, aiming to equip students with essential 21st-century skills. The study assesses the readiness of educational institutions, teachers and students to embrace CT as an integral part of their learning journey, identifying potential challenges and barriers to successful implementation. To achieve these objectives, the research examines the existing landscape of CT education, evaluates teacher preparedness, analyses student receptiveness, and explores resource requirements and best practices from around the world. As part of this investigation, an immersive learning approach will be integrated. A five-day training program was implemented, featuring a comprehensive curriculum that covered key CT concepts, problem-solving techniques, presentation skills, and problem-based learning aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. The program included pre-and post-surveys to measure students' understanding of CT concepts and practical projects to apply their learning. Results showed consistent improvement in students' self-reported understanding of CT skills and their ability to apply these concepts to real-world problems. The study reveals that integrating CT into secondary education is not only necessary but also highly beneficial. The study emphasizes that a holistic educational reform incorporating leadership, technology and curriculum adjustments is essential for the successful implementation of CT education. The study also highlights the importance of aligning CT education with current educational policies and trends, such as KSSM (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Menengah -Secondary School Standard Curricular), which advocate for the inclusion of CT as a fundamental practice of science education. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights and recommendations for educational policymakers, administrators, and educators interested in enhancing CT skills in secondary students.

AB  - The appearance and innovation of computational tools depends on human thinking and initiative, and on the other hand, human thinking is affected by computational tools. The strong function of computational tools in some aspect is superior to that of human brains. It is the application of such strong function that changes the face of human society. At the same time, it presents new methods for scientific research and new perspective for solving problems, promotes human thinking to a higher level, and presents new means for people to understand and change the world. The advantage of computational tools over human brains is the speed, while the initiative ability of human brains is not owned by computational tools. Perfect combination of thinking and computing gives birth to a series of achievements, and lays the foundation of science.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT into educational contexts is reshaping the landscape of student learning and critical thinking. This study investigates the influence of ChatGPT on the critical thinking abilities of university students by enhancing computational strategies for analysis. We developed an advanced computational framework that leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the interaction between students and ChatGPT. Our approach involves the collection and analysis of large-scale interaction data to identify patterns and impacts on critical thinking development. We employed sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and argumentation mining to decode the nature of student responses and their evolution over time. The results reveal significant improvements in critical thinking skills among students who actively engage with ChatGPT, suggesting that the AI can act as a catalyst for developing higher-order thinking skills. This study contributes to the growing body of research on AI in education by providing insights into the mechanisms through which AI tools can enhance critical thinking, and proposes practical implications for integrating such tools into academic curricula.

AB  - This thesis study is an evaluation tool that measures the user's Computational Thinking (CT) according to its performance on Block-Based Programming Languages (BBPL) by using Machine Learning Techniques. The evaluation tool makes an evaluation for Machine Learning Model and each of the Computational Thinking seven fields. Via this developed tool, the objective is to product an alternative to the limited evaluation tools on Block-Based Programming Languages. Literature research was brought out in two sides as Machine Learning and Block-Based Programming Languages. In the first stage, on Machine Learning, the data set and the methods used in educational field were researched. In the second stage, the devices which are used to measure the performance on Block- Based Programming Languages were analyzed. On literature, there are various sources for teaching Computational Thinking ,but it occurs that measuring instruments that evaluates Computational Thinking are inadequate. To evaluate Computational Thinking a machine learning model was trained. Trained model was turned into online evaluation tool by which both the tutors and the students evaluate Computational Thinking easily. In the final stage, the developed online evaluation tool and the outcome was analyzed.

TI  - Mapping computational thinking mindsets between educational levels with cognitive network science
AU  - 
PY  - 
PB  - IEEE
AB  - A significant aspect of computational thinking is as a way of reasoning about the world in terms of data. This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived 'computation' as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around 'data', 'model' and 'simulations' critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.

This study suggest a hamburger flowchart as a teaching material that combines the three elements of "unplugged", "thinking from the end " and "mathematics class". Using this flowchart, basic experiment was conducted for 8 to 12 years old. The purpose of this experiment is to confirm whether it is possible for children to develop both Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking by using the hamburger flowchart. We evaluated both Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking from the state in this class and the content of the worksheet and prior and subsequent tests. As a result, the state related to Computational thinking and Mathematical thinking increased, and the correct answer rate of many children increased from the prior test to the subsequent test. Therefore it turned out that the hamburger flowchart affects mathematical thinking.

AB  - Computational thinking is the process sequence of solving problems and behaves a method of systematic solving problems. Computational thinking is essentially a view of systematic information processing process. In essence, developing the computational thinking of middle school students is to improve their problem-solving ability and the corresponding practical accomplishment. The instructional activity design based on six links of problem solving can well meet the need of cultivating students' computational thinking. The instructional mode of systematic problem solving in middle school can improve students' learning effects and satisfaction, and promote students' computational thinking ability significantly.

JF  - Princeton, NJ, USA
PB  - IEEE
AB  - Computational thinking (CT) is a key competency with a significant impact on students' academic performance in STEM fields. It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.

AB  - Computational Thinking is an essential skill for all students in the 21 st Century. A fundamental question is how can we create computer affordances to empower novice teachers and students, in a variety of STEM and art disciplines, to think computationally while avoiding difficult overhead emerging from traditional coding? Over the last 20 years we have iteratively developed tools that aim to support computational thinking. As these tools evolved a philosophy emerged to support Computational Thinking by joining human abilities with computer affordances. Chief among these findings is that supporting Computational Thinking is much more than making coding accessible. Computational Thinking Tools aim to minimize coding overhead by supporting users through three fundamental stages of the Computational Thinking development cycle: problem formulation, solution expression, and solution execution/evaluation.

Inspired by these two kinds of thinking, we expound how to better carry out teaching practice. The teaching process is task-oriented, teacher-led and student-centered. In the whole teaching process, teachers use the way of integrating computational thinking with practical thinking to prepare courses, design tasks and guide students to complete learning tasks. Compared with the traditional teaching mode, the teaching mode of integrating computational thinking and practical thinking has made great progress in training students' computer practical ability and innovation ability. It can not only improve learning efficiency, but also train students' computer practical ability. Finally, the feasibility and efficiency of this method are verified by Java Web course design.

AB  - Today, Computational Thinking is seen as an important competency and the fourth skill that every child should process. Several significant attempts have been made to increase a student's exposure to Computational Thinking at the K-12 level, however the process is complex and requires systematic planning and comprehensive curriculum. In this paper, we describe the STEPP-UP program that aims to introduce middle schoolers to Computational Thinking via Scratch and Java coding sessions. A comprehensive curriculum and hands-on activities are applied to introduce Computational Thinking for a total of 41 students for a period of five semesters from Fall 2017 until Fall 2019. To assess the learning objectives, we used three methods of evaluation; design-scenarios, paper-assessments, and learner-documentation. Findings indicate that the students have increased knowledge of Computational Thinking and its applications for problem solving.

AB  - As the information age has progressed, computational thinking ability to solve problems has become an indispensable way of life in life. Many scholars believe that the process of solving problems will be more logical if they have computational thinking ability. At the same time, scholars believe that a good learning method improves learners' intrinsic motivation. Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course. The students in the control group first watched the computational thinking explanation video to explain the computational thinking skills to the students, and then taught in the traditional programming robotics course.

AU  - Navid Ahmadi, Mehdi Jazayeri, Monica Landoni

JF  - Rome, Italy
PB  - IEEE
AB  - Game design environments are traditionally used as means for engaging non-programmers in the learning process. However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices. We discuss how to incorporate suggested computational thinking solutions as computer assistant into the game design user interface.

AB  - Critical and computational thinking in primary and secondary education in recent years shows growing importance in methodical approaches used in the classroom. Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market.

AB  - Promoting computational thinking is one of the top priorities in CS education as well as in other STEM and non-STEM disciplines. Our innovative NSF-funded IC2Think project blends computational thinking with creative thinking so that students leverage their creative thinking skills to "unlock" their understanding of computational thinking. In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear "dosage" effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 - 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta 2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta 2 = .106. These findings support our belief that the addition of creative thinking exercises to CSCE courses improves the learning of computational knowledge and skills.

AB  - Computational thinking assessment is an important part of testing the effectiveness of computational thinking cultivation. However, the existing computational thinking assessments still suffer from the problem of insufficient examination of non-cognitive factors, leading to the lack of validity of its assessment results. Since the iceberg model can comprehensively and deeply explore individual characteristics, this paper draws on the division idea of the model and divides computational thinking into explicit computational thinking the basic knowledge required to solve problems using computational thinking and implicit computational thinking the internal psychological characteristics of individuals in the process of using computational thinking. A comprehensive assessment framework of computational thinking is constructed, which contains five dimensions: knowledge and skills, self-efficacy, internet attitude, learning motivation, and thinking style. Finally, its application in the hierarchical teaching of computational thinking and suggestions for personalized teaching programs are given in order to promote the development of personalized education in computational thinking.

Three of these approaches are Mathematical Thinking, Abstract Thinking, and Computational Thinking. Each approach tries to clarify areas of CS that are not directly tied to writing computer programs. In a separate line of research, the current authors have been examining different ways to teach mathematics to CS students. We developed a Computational Math scale that measures the level of problem-solving gestalt exhibited by textbook authors. In this study, we relate our Computational Math framework to current research on Mathematical, Abstract, and Computational (MAC) Thinking. We counted words used frequently in research articles and compared them to words that form the Computational Math scale. Our results suggest an overall MAC Thinking framework that integrates a wide range of topics relevant to computing and programming.
