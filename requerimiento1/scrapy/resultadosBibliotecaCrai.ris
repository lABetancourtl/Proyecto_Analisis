N2  -   We develop a novel generative AI (GenAI) trajectory, "democratization-average trap-model collapse," to identify data and model challenges posed by GenAI, from which we project the GenAI future of consumer research. This trajectory consists of three key phenomena: democratization broadens consumer participation, the average trap produces generic responses, and model collapse occurs when GenAI outputs lose human sensibilities. Data and model challenges arise as democratization enhances data representation while also embedding real-world biases. The average trap, caused by next-token prediction models, leads to generic outputs that lack individuality. Additionally, model collapse occurs when GenAI increasingly learns from its own outputs, amplifying machine bias and diverging from human behavior. To address these challenges, researchers can leverage democratization to study marginalized consumers and prioritize humancentered research over purely data-driven methods. The average trap can be mitigated by fine-tuning models with task-specific and marginalized consumption data while engineering responses for uniqueness. Preventing model collapse requires integrating human-machine hybrid data and applying theories of mind to realign AI with human-centric consumption. Finally, we outline three future research directions: preserving data distribution tails to support consumption democratization, countering the average trap in next-token prediction, and reversing the trajectory from democratization to model collapse.

Tasks that rely on explicit data (information that can be captured and processed) are well suited for gen AI.

N2  -   This study develops an integrated framework, termed the GAI&ABC model, to examine how manufacturing firms can leverage generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to achieve sustainable business model innovation (SBMI) in production systems. While prior research primarily focuses on the technical aspects of AI, we address the challenge of understanding the organisational learning mechanisms that underpin GAI's impact on SBMI. Drawing on the Antecedents-Behaviour-Consequences (ABC) model, we investigate the mediating roles of GAI-powered exploitative and exploratory learning, and consider international entrepreneurship orientation and GAI education as key moderators. Using survey data from 402 manufacturing start-ups in China and employing PLS-SEM analysis, we find that GAI adoption significantly enhances both exploitative learning (b = 0.439, p < 0.001) and exploratory learning (b = 0.444, p < 0.001), which in turn drive SBMI (b = 0.254 and b = 0.353, respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, fsQCA reveals four distinct configurations of these factors that lead to high SBMI performance, highlighting the complexity of GAI implementation. This study contributes a novel theoretical framework that integrates GAI adoption with organisational learning and contextual factors to explain SBMI in production systems, offering actionable insights for firms and addressing the challenge of translating GAI's potential into tangible sustainability outcomes.

N2  -   Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users' contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users' humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI-based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow). This research contributes a novel sociotechnical framework that addresses the challenges of contribution pollution and information cacophony. For the governance of platforms, this research provides actionable guidance on the policy implications of integrating GenAI-based technologies for user- and platform-level outcomes.

AI emerged gradually over more than half a century. Generative AI is a type of machine learning, which involves using data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn and become more accurate.

N2  -   Generative AI (GenAI) may fundamentally reshape how users seek knowledge in online knowledge sharing communities. Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users--motivated by cost-benefit considerations--are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that ChatGPT's arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI's disruptive influence.

A survey yielded 236 valid responses. The data were analyzed via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The key factors identified include organizational readiness (OR), compatibility (CPT), competitive pressure (CP), complexity (CPL), relative advantage (RA), firm size (FS), and government support (GS). OR emerged as the most influential factor because of a robust IT infrastructure and skilled personnel. CPT and CP were also significant, driving banks to adopt GenAI for a competitive edge. However, CPL presents challenges, requiring simpler AI solutions and clear risk mitigation policies. This study enhances the understanding of GenAI adoption within the Vietnamese banking sector, emphasizing the importance of tailored strategies for different bank sizes and the critical role of technology readiness for effective integration.

We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user's intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art.

The results show that GenAI has a moderately positive effect on learning performance ( g = .689). There is no publication bias in determining the validity of the effect. The analysis included the effect sizes of seven moderator variables: sample level, sample size, research design, learning domain, research setting, intervention duration, GenAI tool, and testing format.
