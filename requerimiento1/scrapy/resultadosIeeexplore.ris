PB  - IEEE
AB  - Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.

AB  - With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, the ethical issues of artificial intelligence have become increasingly prominent. This paper discusses the problems of data security, bias and the implantation of morality and values in the ethics of artificial intelligence algorithms, and systematically and comprehensively expounds the main solutions to these three problems. It is found that the current three major technical paths for solving the data security issues have the problems of high dependency, large computation and communication overhead, and limited applicability, and the future trend is the integration and development of the three paths; the solution of the bias problem needs to be improved in terms of interpretability under the condition that the underlying fairness is difficult to be determined; and it is difficult for the implantation of morality and values to take into account the learning ability, adaptability, and interpretability at the same time. Finally, this paper analyzes and looks forward to the development of AI ethics, hoping to provide lessons and references for AI ethics-related research.

PB  - IEEE
AB  - With the proposal of carbon neutrality, more and more new energy sources are used. Assessing the stability of power systems integrated with these new energy sources has become an urgent issue. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence-based method for steady-state analysis of power systems was proposed. This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model. The final result is verified by the actual data of East China Power Grid, which shows the feasibility of the artificial intelligence algorithm.

AB  - While education and technology currently work hand in hand thanks to educational technology, there's a conflict when students want to use a technology that's prohibited by the teachers, usually because of the implications that a new technology (specifically, artificial intelligence tools) can have in the educational development of the students. In this regard, the present paper seeks to propose and describe the current considerations that need to be considered when including artificial intelligence tools and technologies in educational contexts. From the research, it was identified that it is essential to emphasize that artificial intelligence does not seek to replace teachers, but to complement their work, and that artificial intelligence should be used ethically by students and teachers in ways that result beneficial for teaching and learning alike.

AB  - The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.

By leveraging advanced AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), style transfer, and inpainting algorithms, this research demonstrates how machine learning can reconstruct, enhance, and restore artworks with remarkable detail and accuracy. Utilizing datasets of historical paintings, AI systems are trained to reproduce textures, restore faded colors, and even repair damaged sections, maintaining the authenticity of original masterpieces. Quantitative analyses, including image quality metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), are conducted to compare AI-restored paintings with manually restored versions. Results indicate that AI-driven methods achieve high fidelity in texture and color restoration, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for cultural preservation. The study concludes with a discussion on the potential applications of AI in museums and digital archives, emphasizing AI's transformative role in art conservation. Future research could extend these findings by addressing ethical considerations and collaborating closely with art historians to further refine AI's role in cultural heritage.

In response to the scarcity of sample data in the fields of construction and transportation, this paper proposes a data augmentation method based on the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN). This method can learn the latent distribution of original data through a neural network and generate virtual data based on this distribution and specific conditional information, thereby meeting the training requirements of complex predictive models. Experimental validation was conducted on two data augmentation methods, introducing data augmentation tools from image recognition into the rectangular data in the construction and transportation fields for experimental analysis.
