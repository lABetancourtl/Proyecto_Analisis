TI  - The GenAI Future of Consumer Research.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - We develop a novel generative AI (GenAI) trajectory, "democratization-average trap-model collapse," to identify data and model challenges posed by GenAI, from which we project the GenAI future of consumer research. This trajectory consists of three key phenomena: democratization broadens consumer participation, the average trap produces generic responses, and model collapse occurs when GenAI outputs lose human sensibilities. Data and model challenges arise as democratization enhances data representation while also embedding real-world biases. The average trap, caused by next-token prediction models, leads to generic outputs that lack individuality. Additionally, model collapse occurs when GenAI increasingly learns from its own outputs, amplifying machine bias and diverging from human behavior. To address these challenges, researchers can leverage democratization to study marginalized consumers and prioritize humancentered research over purely data-driven methods. The average trap can be mitigated by fine-tuning models with task-specific and marginalized consumption data while engineering responses for uniqueness. Preventing model collapse requires integrating human-machine hybrid data and applying theories of mind to realign AI with human-centric consumption. Finally, we outline three future research directions: preserving data distribution tails to support consumption democratization, countering the average trap in next-token prediction, and reversing the trajectory from democratization to model collapse.

TI  - The effects of GenAI on learning performance : A meta-analysis study
AU  - 
PY  - 2025
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in education, and Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a new concept in AI technology. Educators continue to debate the advantages and disadvantages of GenAI in education. To guide these discussions, further analysis is needed to determine the impact of GenAI on educational outcomes. This study aims to investigate the effect of GenAI on learning performance using the meta-analysis method. This meta-analysis study synthesized the results of 31 articles involving 2646 participants. The results show that GenAI has a moderately positive effect on learning performance ( g = .689). There is no publication bias in determining the validity of the effect. The analysis included the effect sizes of seven moderator variables: sample level, sample size, research design, learning domain, research setting, intervention duration, GenAI tool, and testing format. Only intervention duration, GenAI tool, and testing format significantly moderated the effectiveness of GenAI on learning performance.

TI  - Heterogeneous Effects of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on Knowledge Seeking in Online Communities.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - Generative AI (GenAI) may fundamentally reshape how users seek knowledge in online knowledge sharing communities. Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users--motivated by cost-benefit considerations--are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, we find that ChatGPT's arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI's disruptive influence.

TI  - Generative artificial intelligence.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) technology that can make content such as audio, images, text, and videos. It involves algorithms such as ChatGPT, a chatbot that can produce essays, poetry, and other content requested by a user, and DALL-E, which generates art. AI emerged gradually over more than half a century. Generative AI is a type of machine learning, which involves using data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn and become more accurate. While machine learning can perceive and sort data, generative AI can take the next step and create something based on the information it has. However, it remains expensive, and only a few well-financed companies, including OpenAI, DeepMind, and Meta, have built generative AI models.

AB  - Explorations of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have moved to the forefront of consumer research, as scholars examine its implications for ideation and conceptualization, data collection and analysis, and writing and publishing. Introducing this special section of the Journal of Consumer Research on GenAI and consumer research, the author calls for a critical--and self-critical--engagement with GenAI, calling on researchers to embrace its potential while remaining mindful of both its constraints and their own biases. The author concludes that, given GenAI's rapid evolution, the insights in this special section remain provisional and may require reconsideration as the technology advances. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Are You Willing to Pay for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) Products? Disentangling the Disclosure Effects and the Mediating Role of Psychological Value.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - While digital platform vendors are rapidly offering new generative artificial intelligence products (GAIPs), prior research on algorithmic aversion suggests that users may not respond to them the same way as to the human-generated products (HGPs). We propose that GAIPs induce psychological value, defined as a user's intrinsic desire for a product that can influence their willingness to pay and may depend on the product type. Disclosing a product as a GAIP or HGP could further influence user reactions. From our randomized experiments with three different products representing functional, hybrid, and creative product types, we find psychological value plays an important role in creative products, such as wall art. Human disclosure shows no effect on functional or highly creative products. Our study theoretically extends the algorithmic aversion literature by illustrating the role of psychological value in GAIP highlighting the nuanced role of product type and disclosure in influencing user reactions and offering practical implications.

TI  - Factors influencing generative artificial intelligence adoption in Vietnam's banking sector: an empirical study.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - This study aims to identify the key factors influencing the adoption of generative AI (GenAI) by Vietnamese banks and highlight the challenges and opportunities in digital transformation. It extends the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to incorporate GenAI-specific factors in the Vietnamese banking sector, characterized by rapid digitization and stringent regulations. A survey yielded 236 valid responses. The data were analyzed via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The key factors identified include organizational readiness (OR), compatibility (CPT), competitive pressure (CP), complexity (CPL), relative advantage (RA), firm size (FS), and government support (GS). OR emerged as the most influential factor because of a robust IT infrastructure and skilled personnel. CPT and CP were also significant, driving banks to adopt GenAI for a competitive edge. However, CPL presents challenges, requiring simpler AI solutions and clear risk mitigation policies. This study enhances the understanding of GenAI adoption within the Vietnamese banking sector, emphasizing the importance of tailored strategies for different bank sizes and the critical role of technology readiness for effective integration. The findings provide actionable insights into banks navigating their digital transformation journeys. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Organisations that have integrated AI solutioning and established mature information management strategy are nearly twice as likely to succeed with artificial intelligence (AI) than organisations that have not.1 Given that generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping capital markets with immediate gains in automation and analytics, those who can demonstrate responsible AI use and strong data protection measures may gain a competitive edge in industries where trust and reliability are paramount. As such, there is a drastic push for the adoption of AI technologies within the trade life cycle. While there are significant opportunities that can arise from adopting AI-related technologies, emerging data privacy directives and bespoke AI regulatory frameworks make implementation difficult to navigate. This paper serves to provide its readers with the knowledge and suite of tools requisite for navigating challenges concerning AI integration, organisation and effectuation for a responsible AI experience.

TI  - Leveraging generative artificial intelligence for sustainable business model innovation in production systems.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - This study develops an integrated framework, termed the GAI&ABC model, to examine how manufacturing firms can leverage generative artificial intelligence (GAI) to achieve sustainable business model innovation (SBMI) in production systems. While prior research primarily focuses on the technical aspects of AI, we address the challenge of understanding the organisational learning mechanisms that underpin GAI's impact on SBMI. Drawing on the Antecedents-Behaviour-Consequences (ABC) model, we investigate the mediating roles of GAI-powered exploitative and exploratory learning, and consider international entrepreneurship orientation and GAI education as key moderators. Using survey data from 402 manufacturing start-ups in China and employing PLS-SEM analysis, we find that GAI adoption significantly enhances both exploitative learning (b = 0.439, p < 0.001) and exploratory learning (b = 0.444, p < 0.001), which in turn drive SBMI (b = 0.254 and b = 0.353, respectively, p < 0.001). Furthermore, fsQCA reveals four distinct configurations of these factors that lead to high SBMI performance, highlighting the complexity of GAI implementation. This study contributes a novel theoretical framework that integrates GAI adoption with organisational learning and contextual factors to explain SBMI in production systems, offering actionable insights for firms and addressing the challenge of translating GAI's potential into tangible sustainability outcomes.

AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - Leaders can't afford to take a "wait and see" approach to adopting generative AI. They need a plan for applying it differently than others in the value chain, say the authors. In this article they introduce a framework for thinking about gen AI strategically and offer practical advice on how to apply gen AI to the tasks composing jobs. The framework focuses on two factors: the cost of errors and the type of knowledge required. If an error in carrying out a task would lead to serious harm, financial loss, or reputational damage, firms must be cautious about employing gen AI to perform it without human oversight. Tasks that rely on explicit data (information that can be captured and processed) are well suited for gen AI. But other tasks are fundamentally harder for it to perform because they involve not just retrieving information but also applying tacit knowledge: empathy, ethical reasoning, intuition, and contextual judgment. Placing the tasks in the appropriate quadrant makes it clear which ones gen AI can handle faster, cheaper, or better. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

TI  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)-Based Recommender Addressing Contribution Pollution and Information Cacophony on Digital Platforms.
AU  - 
PY  - 
AB  - Digital platforms facilitate interactions among geographically distributed users which reinforce the positive network effects. However, a disproportionate increase in the contributions of users results in contribution pollution (disproportionate increase in users' contributions) and information cacophony (incoherence of contributions). Unaddressed, contribution pollution and information cacophony challenges have negative implications for platform efficiency and users' humanistic outcomes. This paper highlights the limitations of existing mechanisms and proposes a framework for a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based recommender system. To evaluate the efficacy of the GenAI-based recommender system, we develop an agent-based simulation model and conduct experiments using real data from three platforms (Reddit, Hacker News, and Stack Overflow). This research contributes a novel sociotechnical framework that addresses the challenges of contribution pollution and information cacophony. For the governance of platforms, this research provides actionable guidance on the policy implications of integrating GenAI-based technologies for user- and platform-level outcomes.

JF  - Port Louis, Mauritius
PB  - IEEE
AB  - Social media content is relevant for many applications, including applications that assist in fighting the plague of terrorism through Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, social media content is diverse in its form - text, image, audio, and video. Depending on the nature of the applications, it may be desirable to convert all these forms into a unique format to ease processing. Once the data is converted into text, it is then possible to organize it into structured tabular data to feed Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for real-time terrorist attack detections. This paper explores using the emerging Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) tools for converting social media content (text, image, audio or video) into text format suitable for applying machine learning algorithms. The methodology of this research consisted of studying existing Gen AI tools, evaluating and selecting the best among those that offer API or code integration to implement a tool for converting all forms of social media content into text. The main limitation of this work is the small size of the datasets used in the tools' evaluation. The design and implementation of the proposed solution have been completed, and the tool is ready for use and integration into a framework for collecting and analysing social media content to fight against terrorism.

This paper discusses the problems of data security, bias and the implantation of morality and values in the ethics of artificial intelligence algorithms, and systematically and comprehensively expounds the main solutions to these three problems. It is found that the current three major technical paths for solving the data security issues have the problems of high dependency, large computation and communication overhead, and limited applicability, and the future trend is the integration and development of the three paths; the solution of the bias problem needs to be improved in terms of interpretability under the condition that the underlying fairness is difficult to be determined; and it is difficult for the implantation of morality and values to take into account the learning ability, adaptability, and interpretability at the same time. Finally, this paper analyzes and looks forward to the development of AI ethics, hoping to provide lessons and references for AI ethics-related research.

JF  - Harbin, China
PB  - IEEE
AB  - With the proposal of carbon neutrality, more and more new energy sources are used. Assessing the stability of power systems integrated with these new energy sources has become an urgent issue. To address this challenge, an artificial intelligence-based method for steady-state analysis of power systems was proposed. This method employed both the Newton-Raphson method and PQ decomposition to calculate the power flow within the power system. Subsequently, artificial intelligence techniques were utilized to evaluate the reliability of the results by analyzing error characteristics. This approach differed from traditional artificial intelligence methods by incorporating generative adversarial network-based data set expansion technology and a multi-scale fusion neural network model. The final result is verified by the actual data of East China Power Grid, which shows the feasibility of the artificial intelligence algorithm.

AB  - The image conversion of clothing sketches has enormous application value in fields such as visual editing, clothing design, and human-computer interaction. At present, most of the objects converted from sketches are relatively simple shapes, such as faces, human postures, animal postures, shoes, and bags. At present, sketch conversion-based work is difficult to handle images with complex texture structures, making it challenging to solve the task of image conversion for clothing sketches. Additionally, the lack of clothing datasets is also a difficult problem to solve. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes using an edge detection algorithm to generate clothing simulation sketches in reverse, solving the problem of missing clothing sketch datasets. Then, combined with generative adversarial networks in the field of artificial intelligence, the Cloth Sketch GAN (CSG) network framework is proposed. It improves the generator and discriminator on the basis of the pix2pix network, and enhances the image generation effect by adding an attention module in the generator of the U-Net network structure. Two scales of discriminators are used to discriminate the images separately, and multiple layers of feature extraction are introduced based on the two scales of discriminators. The design of the feature matching loss function and perception loss function is added to make the generated images more realistic and clear, thus completing the conversion from clothing sketch to clothing image. Applied research. Finally, experiments were conducted on the clothing dataset constructed in this article, and the results showed that Cloth Sketch GAN had a significant improvement in the performance of generating clothing images. Moreover, with the improved network proposed in this article, the task of converting clothing sketches to real clothing images can be effectively accomplished on the clothing dataset.

AB  - In response to the problems of high false detection rate, complex computation, difficulty in timely responding and defending against new unknown attacks, and high defense costs in network security defense, a defense method combining network intrusion detection and defense based on artificial intelligence technology is designed. The Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network model is used for network intrusion detection, and the random gradient descent optimization algorithm is used to train the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network model. Finally, the test results of intrusion detection are obtained using Matlab software. The experimental results show that the evaluation values of the proposed detection method are all superior to those of the generative adversarial network model detection method. The accuracy rate has increased by 11.93 percentage points, the precision rate has increased by 9.89 percentage points, the false detection rate has decreased by 4.82 percentage points, the recall rate has increased by 13.57 percentage points, and the F1 score has increased by 12.94 percentage points. The false detection rate and packet rejection rate of the proposed network security defense method are lower, effectively ensuring the security of the network.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the field of education is an unprecedented trend with the potential to revolutionize teaching approaches and significantly improve the overall learning experience. This workshop offers an opportunity for a strategic implementation of generative artificial intelligence in higher education, demonstrating its capacity to substantially enhance the creation and customization of digital educational materials. It is essential for educators to possess the capacity to utilize generative artificial tools, specifically when it comes to developing prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs). In addition to fostering a more interactive learning environment, these LLMs are driving the transition to educational systems that are more autonomous and adaptable. An in-depth exploration of the pragmatic and ethical aspects of AI implementation is undertaken to equip educators with the necessary knowledge and skills to employ AI in a responsible manner, thereby cultivating an engaging and equitable learning environment.

JF  - Suzhou, China
PB  - IEEE
AB  - The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence technology has accelerated the reform in the field of education and opened up a new development path for English writing teaching in middle schools. However, in the actual teaching process, there are still problems with the rigid application of artificial intelligence and the lack of data support for learning situation analysis. Therefore, exploring the deep integration model of generative artificial intelligence technology and English writing teaching in middle schools is particularly urgent. By the theory of process-genre approach and blended teaching model, we construct a teaching model of middle school English writing assisted by generative artificial intelligence from three dimensions: teaching resources, teaching process and teaching evaluation. This teaching model realizes the enrichment and personalization of teaching resources, integrates generative artificial intelligence into every step of the teaching process, and comprehensively improves the teaching efficiency and quality of English writing in middle school.
